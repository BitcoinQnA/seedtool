# Bitcoin Seed Tool

This tool offers a space for bitcoiners to experiment and learn how bitcoin wallets are generated using different sources of entropy (randomness). The page also offers many other seed related functionalites, some of which are outlined below. The online version can be found at https://bitcoiner.guide/seed.

### Offline Usage

NEVER use the online version of this tool to create or interact with seeds used to manage real bitcoin. While there is nothing in this tool that collects private information or sends it anywhere, there may be other software on your device that does. If the tool detects a network connection, it will display a network symbol in the top corner of the screen. 

To use this tool offline, use the download link in the [online version](https://bitcoiner.guide/seed) or download the `index.html` from the [releases page](https://github.com/BitcoinQnA/seedtool/releases).

### Usage

Some common use cases for this tool include:-

- Learning how entropy is used to derive wallet components
- Generating seeds via dice rolls, coin flips or playing cards
- Verifying entropy inputs (dice rolls etc) applied to external wallets or signers
- Generating BIP85 child seeds (or check those generated by a signing device)
- Generating BIP47 payment codes and their corresponding PayNym avatars
- Generating BIP47 addresses between any two payment codes
- Verifying wallet address generation from a given seed/passphrase combination
- Testing for a forgotten/incorrect passphrase (if you know a receive address)


### Donations

If you find this page useful, consider [donating](https://paynym.is/+purplefire896) some sats to the lead developer [SuperPhatArrow](https://github.com/SuperPhatArrow) or to any of the open source [libraries](https://bitcoiner.guide/seed/#libraries) this tool was built on top of.

### Verification

To verify the tool, take the following steps.

1. Download and import the public copy of the PGP signing key owned by [Bitcoin QnA](https://github.com/BitcoinQnA)

`curl -sL https://bitcoiner.guide/public.key | gpg --import`

2. Download the latest [release](https://github.com/BitcoinQnA/seedtool/releases) `index.html` and `signature.txt` files

3. Navigate to your Downloads folder and run `sha256sum index.html`

4. Check for an exact hash match as the one published in the `signature.txt` file

5. Run `gpg --verify signature.txt` and look for a **Good Signature from "BitcoinQnA <bitcoinqna@tutanota.com>"**


# Development

### Install nodejs
Make sure nodejs is installed:
```
node --version
```
If not, I recommend [Node Version Manager (nvm)](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#readme).
Then use nvm to make sure you are using the latest LTS version:
```
nvm install --lts
```

```
nvm use --lts
```

### Install development dependencies
In the root directory of the project type:
```
npm i
```

### Ready to code
In the root directory of the project type:
```
npm run dev
```
Open browser to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)
change files in your code editor of choice and the webpage will reload on save of files in the src folder.

If you get an error that port 8080 is still in use, you can kill the process with this command:
```
npx kill-port 8080
```
After that you should be able to start the development script with:
```
npm run dev
```

### Build
```
npm run build
```
Builds the output html file to the dist directory for distribution

### GIT add, commit and push
```
MSG="Added this awesome new feature" npm run git
```
Will run the build script and push your changes to git
